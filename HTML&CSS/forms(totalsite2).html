        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>1. Introduction
        Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("Content").
        
        Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the Spotify Privacy Policy and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.
        
        By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
        
        THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.
        
        Service provider
        These Terms are between you and Spotify USA Inc., 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY, 10007.
        
        Age and eligibility requirements
        BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
        
        2. The Spotify Service
        Spotify Service options
        We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
        
        Trials
        From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.
        
        Third-party applications, devices and open source software
        The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.
        
        Service limitations and modifications
        We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:
        
        The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.
        We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional offerings).
        Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.
        If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and cancellations" section below), Spotify will refund you the prorated portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.
        
        Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.
        
        3. Your Use of the Spotify Service
        Creating a Spotify account
        You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our Customer Service team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.
        
        Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.
        
        Your rights to use the Spotify Service
        Access to the Spotify Service
        
        Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "Access"). This Access shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by you or Spotify. You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.
        
        The Spotify software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your Devices.
        
        Spotify's proprietary rights
        
        The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand ("Spotify Brand Features") are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.
        
        You agree to abide by the Spotify User Guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by these Terms.
        
        Payments and cancellation
        Billing
        
        You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:
        
        paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or
        prepayment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("Prepaid Period").
        Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.
        
        If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. Please contact the third party regarding any refunds or to manage your subscription. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Codes"), you hereby agree to the Spotify Card Terms.
        
        If you purchase Audiobook Content outside of your Paid Subscription, your purchase will be governed by the Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions.
        
        Price and tax changes
        
        Spotify may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Prepaid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
        
        Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.
        
        Renewal and cancellation
        
        With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Prepaid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our Customer Support team here for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.
        
        If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated with your Code, or when there is an insufficient prepaid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.
        
        User guidelines
        We've established guidelines for using the Spotify Service, to make sure the Spotify Service stays enjoyable for everyone ("Spotify User Guidelines"). In using the Spotify Service, you must comply with the Spotify User Guidelines, as well as all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and respect the intellectual property, privacy, and other rights of third parties.
        
        Brand accounts
        If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand ( "Brand," and such account a "Brand Account"), the terms "you" and "your," as used throughout these Terms (including other Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein), apply to both you and the Brand.
        
        If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms (including any other applicable Spotify terms and conditions) and to bind the Brand to these Terms.
        
        A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement. In addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.
        
        Export control and sanctions
        Certain Spotify products and services are subject to trade control laws, including the export control and economic sanctions laws of the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State, Regulation 2021/821 as amended (EU Dual-Use Regulation), the UK Export Control Act 2002 and the UK Export Control Order 2008 (collectively, "Trade Control Laws"). You represent and warrant that you are (1) not located in, organized under the laws of, or ordinarily resident in any country or territory subject to territorial sanctions ("Sanctioned Country"), nor are you owned by or acting on behalf of a Government subject to asset-blocking sanctions or any person or entity organized, located or ordinarily resident in a Sanctioned Country; and (2) not a person identified on, or more than 50% owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by or acting on behalf or at the direction of any entity identified on, U.S., E.U., U.K., or other applicable government restricted party lists, such as the Specially Designated Nationals List maintained by OFAC, the Consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanctions, or the UK Consolidated List.
        
        You agree to comply with all applicable Trade Control Laws in your use of the Spotify Service. Specifically, you agree not to, directly or indirectly, use, sell, supply, export, reexport, transfer, divert, release, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under these Terms to any destination, entity, or person or for any end use prohibited by applicable Trade Controls Laws. Spotify shall not be required to act in any way that is prohibited under applicable Trade Control Laws, and it shall be in the sole discretion of Spotify to refrain from being directly or indirectly involved in the provision of products or services that may be prohibited under applicable Trade Control Laws.
        
        4. Content and Intellectual Property Rights
        User Content
        The content you post on the Spotify Service
        
        Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Spotify Service ("User Content"). For the avoidance of doubt, User Content includes all information, materials and other content that is added, created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, or posted to the Spotify Service (including to the Spotify Support Community) by users.
        
        You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.
        
        You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content; and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify pursuant to the license granted below, does not: (i) violate these Terms, including the Spotify User Guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property or other rights of any third party; or (ii) imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, or other individual or entity without the prior express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.
        
        In posting or sharing User Content or other information on the Spotify Service, please keep in mind that content and other information will be publicly accessible, and may be used and re-shared by others on the Spotify Service and across the web, so please use caution in posting or sharing on the Spotify Service, and be mindful of your account settings. Spotify is not responsible for what you or others post or share on the Spotify Service.
        
        Monitoring user content
        
        Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor or review User Content. Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason. Spotify may take these actions without prior notification to you.
        
        Licenses that you grant to us
        User Content
        
        You retain ownership of your User Content when you post it to the Spotify Service. However, in order for us to make your User Content available on the Spotify Service, we do need a limited license from you to that User Content. Accordingly, you hereby grant to Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, make available, perform and display, translate, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, and otherwise use any such User Content through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created, in connection with the Spotify Service. Where applicable and to the extent permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive, and not to enforce, any "moral rights" or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.
        
        Feedback
        
        If you provide ideas, suggestions, or other feedback in connection with your use of the Spotify Service or any Content ("Feedback"), such Feedback is not confidential and may be used by Spotify without restriction and without payment to you. Feedback is considered a type of User Content under these Terms.
        
        Your Device
        
        You also grant to us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Spotify Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.
        
        Content experience
        
        In any part of the Spotify Service, the Content that you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify's agreements with third parties.
        
        Some Content licensed by, provided to, created by, or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g., podcasts or shows) may incorporate advertising or other promotional messages.
        
        Infringement claims
        
        Spotify respects the rights of intellectual property owners. If you believe that any Content infringes your copyright rights, please see the Spotify Copyright Policy.
