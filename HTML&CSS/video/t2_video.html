    <h4>Method</h4>
    <pre>
        STEP 1
        Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/
        gas 4. Oil and line the base and 
        sides of two 20cm cake tins with 
        baking parchment. Whisk the oil, 
        yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in 
        a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon
        and nutmeg with a good pinch of 
        salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps 
        of sugar through your fingers, shaking
        the bowl a few times to bring the
        lumps to the surface.
        
        STEP 2
        Add the wet ingredients to the dry, 
        along with the carrots, raisins and 
        half the nuts, if using. Mix well to 
        combine, then divide between the tins.
        
        STEP 3
        Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer 
        inserted into the centre of the cake 
        comes out clean. If any wet mixture 
        clings to the skewer, return to the 
        oven for 5 mins, then check again. 
        Leave to cool in the tins.
        
        STEP 4
        To make the icing, beat the butter 
        and sugar together until smooth. 
        Add half the soft cheese and beat 
        again, then add the rest (adding it 
        bit by bit prevents the icing from 
        splitting). Remove the cakes from the 
        tins and sandwich together with half 
        the icing. Top with the remaining icing 
        and scatter with the remaining walnuts. 
        Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. 
        Best eaten at room temperature.
