    <pre>
        Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
        Am I wrong for saying that I'll choose another way?
        I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
        Just cause everybody doing what they all do
        If one thing I know, how far would I grow?
        I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
        So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
        Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
        But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
        Am I tripping for having a vision?
        My prediction; I'mma be on the top of the world
        Hope you, hope you don't look back, always do what you decide
        Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
        Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
        Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel
        So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
        Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
        But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
        I don't wanna be right, right
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
        I don't wanna be right
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
        I don't wanna be right, right
        If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
        I don't wanna be right
        So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
        Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
        But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
        That's just how I feel
        That's just how I feel
        That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
