            Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only
            Man's not hot, never hot
            Skrrat (GottiOnEm), skidi-kat-kat
            Boom
            Two plus two is four
            Minus one that's three, quick maths
            Everyday man's on the block
            Smoke trees (Ah)
            See your girl in the park
            That girl is a uckers
            When the ting went quack-quack-quack
            You man were ducking (You man ducked)
            Hold tight, Asznee (My brudda)
            He's got the pumpy (Big ting)
            Hold tight, my man (My guy)
            He's got the frisbee (Shew)
            I trap, trap, trap on the phone
            Movin' that cornflakes (Uh)
            Rice Krispies
            Hold tight, my girl Whitney (My G)
            On, on, on, on, on the road doin' ten toes
            Like my toes (Like my toes)
            You man thought I froze
            I see a peng girl, then I pose (Chilin')
            If she ain't on it, I ghost
            Hah, look at your nose (Check your nose, fam)
            You donut
            Nose long like garden hose
            I tell her man's not hot
            I tell her man's not hot
            The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
            I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (Never hot)
            I tell her man's not hot (Never hot)
            I tell her man's not hot (Never hot)
            The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
            I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (Never hot)
            Hop out the four-door with the .44
            It was one, two, three and four (Us, man)
            Chillin' in the corridor (Yo)
            Your dad is forty-four (Uh)
            And he's still callin' man for a draw (Look at him)
            Let him know
            When I see him
            I'm gonna spin his jaw (Finished)
            Take man's Twix by force (Take it)
            Send man's shop by force (Send him)
            Your girl knows I've got the sauce (Flexin')
            No ketchup (None)
            Just sauce (Saucy)
            Raw sauce
            Ah, yo, boom, ah

            I tell her man's not hot (Never hot)
            The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
            I said, "Babes, man's not hot"
            Man can never be hot (Never hot)
            Perspiration ting (Spray dat)
