        Almost heaven, West Virginia
        Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
        Life is old there, older than the trees
        Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
        Country roads, take me home
        To the place I belong
        West Virginia, mountain mama
        Take me home, country roads
        All my memories gather 'round her
        Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
        Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
        Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
        Country roads, take me home
        To the place I belong
        West Virginia, mountain mama
        Take me home, country roads
        I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
        The radio reminds me of my home far away
        Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
        That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
        Country roads, take me home
        To the place I belong
        West Virginia, mountain mama
        Take me home, country roads
        Country roads, take me home
        To the place I belong
        West Virginia, mountain mama
        Take me home, country roads
        Take me home, down country roads
        Take me home, down country roads
