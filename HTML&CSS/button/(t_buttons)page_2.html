    <dd>Digital nomads are people who travel freely while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work">working remotely</a> using technology and the internet.[1] Such people generally have minimal material possessions and work remotely in temporary housing, hotels, cafes, <b>public libraries</b>, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles, using <big>Wi-Fi</big>, smartphones or mobile hotspots to access the Internet. <sup>[1][2][3][4][5]</sup> The majority of digital nomads describe themselves as programmers, content creators, designers, or developers.[4] Some digital nomads are perpetual travelers, while others only maintain the lifestyle for a short period of time. While some nomads travel through multiple countries, others remain in one area, and some may choose to travel while living in a vehicle, in a practice often known as <i>van-dwelling</i>.[6] In 2023, there are 17.3 million American digital nomads, which is a <tt>131%</tt> increase since 2019.[7]</dd>
