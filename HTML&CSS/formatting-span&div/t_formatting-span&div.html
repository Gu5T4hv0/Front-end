    <h3>What is a cat?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The cat (Felis catus), 
        commonly referred to as
         the domestic cat or house
         cat, is the only domesticated 
         species in the family <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae">Felidae</a>.
         Recent advances in archaeology 
         and genetics have shown that the
          domestication of the cat occurred
           in the 
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East#:~:text=The%20Near%20East%20is%20a,Anatolia%2C%20East%20Thrace%20and%20Egypt.">Near East</a> around <i>7500 BC</i>. 
           It is commonly kept as a house pet 
           and farm cat, but also ranges freely 
           as a feral cat avoiding <big>human contact</big>. 
           It is <u>valued</u> by humans for companionship
           and its ability to kill <small>vermin</small>. Because of 
           its retractable <tt>claws</tt>, it is adapted to 
           <div style="background-color: red;">killing</div> small prey like mice and rats. 
           It has a strong, flexible body, quick 
           reflexes, sharp teeth, and its <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Vision">night 
           vision</a> and sense of smell are well developed. 
           It is a social species, but a solitary <div style="color: red;">hunter</div> 
           and a crepuscular <sub>predator</sub>. Cat <sup>communication</sup> 
           includes vocalizations like <b>meowing, purring, 
           trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting</b> as 
           well as cat body language <del>sure</del>. It can hear sounds 
           too faint or too high in frequency for human 
           ears, such as those made by small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a>. 
           It also secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
